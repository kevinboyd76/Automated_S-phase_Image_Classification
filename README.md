# Automated_S-phase_Image_Classification
Deep Learning Image analysis to automatically segment and classify cells into 5 distinct patterns. 

## Previous studies have classified cells in S-phase into 5 distinct patterns
![Stages](/images/Cell_Stages)

## In order to make this process more reproducible and increase the throughput we have created automated segmentation and classification models in order to isolate and identify the stage each of the stages the cells are in.

## CNN Architecture
